# Lunar Buggy 3D

## Description
Practically the same project as [Program Lunar Jeep](https://github.com/Pdzoc/Program-Lunar-Jeep) but with Three.js to visualise the vehicle and with more animations (which probably will be more attractive for attractive). The rules of the game are the same: lead the vehicle to the base (the green box) and avoid the "rocks".

The player can choose the level, but typing too big number returns the vehicle on an empty board.

## Controls
- Arrows or WSAD to move the camera
- Z/X to zoom in/zoom out
